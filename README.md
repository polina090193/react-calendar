# React calendar
React app using Todoist API.
It was an exercise before the calendar view was done by Todoist team :)

- [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#javascript-sdk)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm start`:

    git clone https://github.com/polina090193/react-calendar
    npm install
    npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage
- you can use default API key (included) or change it to your own in `src/api/todoAPI.ts`
- you can open a day and add new task in a dialog window
- you can close a task clicking on the checkbox
- you can drag&drop tasks between days
